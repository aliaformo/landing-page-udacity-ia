                    </article>

                    <p>ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) is a large language model-based chatbot
                        developed by
                        OpenAI, notable for enabling users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length,
                        format,
                        style, level of detail, and language used. Successive prompts and replies, are taken into
                        account at each
                        stage of the conversation as a context. Developed by OpenAI and released in 2022. <span>Learn

                    <h3>Main Features</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is a sibling model to InstructGPT, which is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt
                            and provide
                            a detailed response.</li>
                        <li>It is fine-tuned from a model in the GPT-3.5 series, which finished training in early 2022.
                        </li>
                        <li>ChatGPT and GPT-3.5 were trained on an Azure AI super computing infrastructure.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Limitations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sometimes it writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers.</li>
                        <li>It is sensitive to tweaks to the input phrasing or attempting the same prompt multiple
                            times.</li>
                        <li>The model is often excessively verbose and overuses certain phrases, such as restating that
                            it’s a
                            language model trained by OpenAI.</li>

                        initially on
                        the LaMDA family of large language models (LLMs) and later the PaLM LLM. It was developed as a
                        direct
                        response to the rise of OpenAI's ChatGPT, and was released in a limited capacity in 2023 to
                        lukewarm
                        responses. <span>Learn more <a
